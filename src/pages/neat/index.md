# Useful tools

Here is a collection of some of the tools that I use (IDEs, keyboards, etc.) 

This page is mostly for my own reference, but if you're here maybe you'll find something interesting as well.

## Hardware

- [Kinesis Advantage 2 LF](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/), an ergonomic keyboard. 
- [Elecom Deft Pro Trackball Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Trackball-M-DPT1MRXBK-Bluetooth-High-Performance-Responsiveness/dp/B07C9T4TTW). 
  - After receiving the fancy ergonomic keyboard, I figured I would go all-in on the ergonomics and get a trackball mouse as well. No carpal tunnel yet! 
- [This laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089VKD8LK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to complete the ergonomic setup.
