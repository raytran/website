In the 2020 Fall semester, I took 6.031 Software Construction. This class covers the essential topics in software engineering,
including unit testing, rigorous documentation, etc through Java program development.

The final project was to create a collaborative crossword program, similar to [Down for a Cross](https://downforacross.com/).

Our group used Vue for the frontend, and a multithreaded Java backend. The backend used the [monitor pattern](http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa20/classes/22-locks/#monitor_pattern) extensively for safe concurrency.

Per the course policy, I am unable to provide the full source, but here are some nice screenshots of the website:

And when you win....
